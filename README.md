# Create a Admin Dashboard using React

In This Project I've build a React admin dashboard. The UI Reference is taken from the Start Bootstrap Admin Panel. In Which user can analysis using Charts(Area Chart, Bar Chart & Pie Chart) and Table. 

## Features

- `Data Visualization` : The dashboard allows users to visualize data in various formats, such as charts, graphs, and tables. It supports popular libraries like charts.js and react-chartjs-2. JavaScript is used to create insightful data representations.
- `Responsive Design` : The dashboard is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to different screen sizes and devices, providing an optimal viewing experience for users on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
- `User Authentication`: Secure user authentication Route builded to protect sensitive data and ensure that only authorized users can access the dashboard. Login, Register and Forget Password Routes are provided.
- `User Navigation` : A common responssive Header and Sidebar is used so that user can navigate to the other route. 
- `State Management` : For Global State management React Context is used and the another hand React Hooks is used for the local state management. User can easily control the sidebar in different screen through global state management.
- `Switch Theme`: The dashboard allows users to switch the Sider Menu Theme between Dark and Light mode through the Context.
